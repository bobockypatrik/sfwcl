# sfwcl

This is source of sfwcl of crymp.net, please use Microsoft Visual C++ to compile, G++ is acceptable too, but due to little bit different ABI's not everything's gonna work as expected.

Unmodified version of zlib library from https://github.com/madler/zlib is used here.

This software is licenced under GPLv3 licence. So if you ever decide to make some improvements, I would kindly ask you to commit to existing repo (this one) after creating your fork and making changes instead of creating own one and splitting community once again by creating another solution.

TODOs:
 - fully working 64 bit version
 - asynchronous network communication for verifying servers, logging in, so UX is more fluid
 - ingame map downloader without admin permissions

Other useful tools:
 - Wireshark
 - ollydbg2.0.1 or x64dbg
 - Crysis 1.2 Mod SDK
